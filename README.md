Here is an example of how you can structure the `README.md` file to explain your project, which consists of two parts: a Python script and a website.

# Stress Test Tool

This project provides two ways to stress test a system: using a Python script or a web-based interface. You can choose to run the stress test through a Python script or interact with a website that lets you control the load.

## Overview

The Stress Test Tool allows you to simulate heavy CPU load on a system. You can control the load dynamically and monitor its effect in real-time through a gauge chart.

### Features
- **Python Script**: Allows you to run the stress test directly via the command line.
- **Website Interface**: Provides a graphical interface with sliders and buttons to control the load.

## Requirements

### For Python Script:
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies:
  - `psutil` (for system resource monitoring)

### For Website Interface:
- A modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or local server for development)

## Python Script

The Python script is designed to simulate a CPU stress test. It allows you to control the load level and execute the test from the command line.

### How to Run Python Script

1. Navigate to the `py` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/stress.py/py
   ```

2. Run the `stress.py` script:
   ```bash
   python stress.py
   ```

3. Modify the script if you want to adjust load or add custom behavior. The script leverages CPU usage control based on the settings you configure.

## Website Interface

The website provides an interactive way to run the stress test. It uses JavaScript and HTML to allow dynamic control over the load, with a gauge displaying the current CPU stress level.
Visit the website: https://rubikproxy.github.io/stress.py/

The website interface includes:

A load control slider to adjust the stress level from 1% to 100%.
A "Start Stress Test" button that starts or stops the test.
A real-time gauge chart that shows the current CPU load.
Use the buttons to increase or decrease the load, and the website will update the stress test accordingly.

This `README.md` file provides a clear structure and includes the basic usage for both the Python script and the website interface. It also includes sections for requirements, how to run each component, and general project information. Adjust the directory paths and instructions as per your specific setup.
