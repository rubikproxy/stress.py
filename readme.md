# Stress Test Tool 🖥️💪

This project provides two ways to stress test a system: using a Python script 🐍 or a web-based interface 🌐. You can choose to run the stress test through a Python script or interact with a website that lets you control the load.

## Overview 🔍

The Stress Test Tool allows you to simulate heavy CPU load on a system ⚡. You can control the load dynamically and monitor its effect in real-time through a gauge chart 📊.

### Features 🎉
- **Python Script** 🐍: Allows you to run the stress test directly via the command line.
- **Website Interface** 🌐: Provides a graphical interface with sliders and buttons to control the load.

## Requirements 📦

### For Python Script:
- Python 3.x 🐍
- Dependencies:
  - `psutil` (for system resource monitoring)

### For Website Interface:
- A modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) 🌐
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or local server for development) 🖥️

## Python Script 🐍

The Python script is designed to simulate a CPU stress test. It allows you to control the load level and execute the test from the command line.

### How to Run Python Script 🚀

1. Navigate to the `py` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /stress.py/py
   ```

2. Run the `stress.py` script:
   ```bash
   python stress.py
   ```

3. Modify the script if you want to adjust load or add custom behavior. The script leverages CPU usage control based on the settings you configure.

## Website Interface 🌐

The website provides an interactive way to run the stress test. It uses JavaScript and HTML to allow dynamic control over the load, with a gauge displaying the current CPU stress level.

Visit the website: [https://rubikproxy.github.io/stress.py/](https://rubikproxy.github.io/stress.py/) 🌐

The website interface includes:

- A load control slider to adjust the stress level from 1% to 100% 🎛️
- A "Start Stress Test" button that starts or stops the test 🟢🔴
- A real-time gauge chart that shows the current CPU load 📊

Use the buttons to increase or decrease the load, and the website will update the stress test accordingly.
